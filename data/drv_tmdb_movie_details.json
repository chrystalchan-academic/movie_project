Camping on the porch of the Poor House would become the most-used prevalent plot line in the 27 series-films that followed. It was also an issue in the comic-strip for about a year after its inception when it was basically a continuity strip but, aside from Dagwood's inability to coax a pay-raise from Mr. Dithers over the years, the financial status of the family was seldom an issue when the format switched to a gag-a-day strip.","3929":"Columbia's Blondie series continued its winning streak with its fourth entry, Blondie Brings Up Baby.

Complications ensue: Blondie's sister comes to visit, and Dagwood is put in a compromising situation with another woman.","3936":"Few of the popular Blondie films strayed as far off the tried-and-true Blondie formula as \"Blondie Has Servant Trouble\" (#6 in the series).  Things get under way when Blondie Bumstead (Penny Singleton) demands that her husband Dagwood (Arthur Lake) request a raise from his boss Mr. Dithers (Jonathan Hale), so that Blondie can afford to hire a maid.  But Dithers has no time for any salary disputes: his construction firm is currently stuck with an unsaleable old mansion, which is rumored to be haunted.  To disprove this theory, Dithers asks the Bumstead family to spend a night in the crumbling old house, throwing a retinue of servants into the bargain.  Homicidal maniacs? The Bumsteads in mortal danger?  But even a done 1000 times 'Haunted House-Homicidal Maniac' storyline somehow works here..  Because  in the end, no matter what, there's always Penny Singleton as \"Blondie\".","3937":"Dagwood wants to join the trout club and Blondie wants a fur coat.

Mr. Dithers invites the Bumstead's on a South American cruise.  Somehow Dagwood winds up as the female drummer in the ship's band, while Penny Singleton gets to show off her Broadway background in some lively musical numbers.","3942":"Number 10 in the Blondie series, Blondie Goes to College is predicated on the notion that Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake) must receive a college diploma or lose his job with the Dithers Construction Company.  Not wishing to be separated from her husband, Blondie (Penny Singleton) enrolls in college as well.  But Leighton College rules stipulate \"No Married Couples\", forcing Blondie and Dagwood to pretend that they're not married.

Thus it was that Columbia's 13th \"Blondie\" picture was shipped out as It's a Great Life.  The comic confusion begins when Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake), intending to buy a house, buys a horse instead.  Before the film's 75 minutes have run their course, Dagwood gets mixed up in a fox hunt.  But Blondie (Penny Singleton) saves the day as usual, with the help of eccentric millionaire Timothy Brewster (Hugh Herbert).  After It's a Great Life and #14 \"Footlight Glamour\", Columbia restored the name \"Blondie\" to the titles of all subesequent installments in this long-running comedy series.","3961":"After a nearly two-year layoff, Columbia revived its moneymaking \"Blondie\" series with 1945's Leave It to Blondie.

Along the way, Blondie's blood boils when Dagwood gets innocently mixed up with beautiful music teacher Rita Rogers (Marjorie Weaver).  The best scenes involve Dagwood's misguided efforts to cure a cold, leading to several motheaten but still reliable slapstick setpieces.  Leave it to Blondie proved that the series hadn't lost its humor as Dagwood is arrested for murder, obliging our heroine to solve the case herself. Former bandleader Kirby Grant registers well as the nominal hero, while Milburn Stone scores as an imitation Walter Winchell (named \"Winchester\", no less!)","3966":"Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake) poses as his boss Mr. Dithers (Jonathan Hale) so that a big business deal can be consummated while Dithers avoids nearsighted process server Jim Gray (Shemp Howard). The upshot of all this is that Dagwood ends up in a lunatic asylum, forcing Blondie (Penny Singleton) to come to the rescue. Number 18 in the long running Blondie series.  Blondie Knows Best was writer\/director Edward Bernds' first entry in the long-running \"Blondie\" series, and arguably his funniest.  Bernds was a big fan of comedian Shemp Howard (whom he'd directed in several Columbia 2-reelers) and accordingly he gives Shemp free reign in his scenes, resulting in some hystericially funny moments.  Blondie Knows Best represented Jonathan Hale's farewell to the series; in the next entry, Blondie's Big Moment, he would be replaced by Jerome Cowan as Mr. Radcliffe","3967":"Blondie's Lucky Day is the 17th entry in the long-running Blondie film series based on the comic strip by Chic Young.\r Blondie's Lucky Day, indeed!
