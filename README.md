### For team member, please read:
## Instructions
1. Git
	- Always pull latest master branch
	- start a new branch from a master whenever you work on, it will be best to avoid to work on master branch first. 
	- After your code is done, you can merge with master branch.
2. Folder organization
	- It will be useful to follow the practice in "Best pracice for data structure". But we can keep it simple by at least storing in an organized structure.
	- /data: data files 
	- /documents: any relevent answers to question asked in project guideline, photos of sketches to visualizations
	- /python_notebook: python notebook
	- /r: r code if there is any
	- feel free to add folders if seems apprpriate
3. README.md
	- Please update the README file on how to run your code or any package we have to install.
	- if you see any useful resources, add into "Links for resources ". 
4. Coding practice
	- we don't have to comment everything, but if the section you write seems complicated, please add some comment.
	- It will be useful to follow the practice in "Best pracice for Python", you can look at only Naming section. The most important part is keep the variable naming convention consistuent.
5. Feel free to add any other suggestion~~
